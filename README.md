# IMGRenamer

IMGRenamer is a tool written in Python, this tool take Keynote files ,extract the images and then rename all the images of the folder that you specified.
In my current job we have a task regarding the renaming of several images (Sometimes 10 and sometimes 500).
Before I developed this tool the task was made manually and take a lot of time, now we can rename 300 images in 1 second.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the requirements, run this on your terminal

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
Now Select the folder that contains your keynote file.

When another window prompts , select the folder that contains the images that you need to be renamed.

Finished!
